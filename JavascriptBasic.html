				<p id="jsbasic">This blog post enables you to get started with JavaScript as quickly as possible – if you already know how to program. It describes the smallest subset of the language that allows you to be productive. I call that subset “Basic JavaScript” and recommend to program in it for a while, before moving on to more details and advanced topics. Learning everything at once is too confusing. The post concludes with tips for what to learn next.
                Warning: Below, I’m describing rules of thumbs and best practices. I favor clarity over precision (e.g., whenever you see the word “roughly”). The rules are safe, but – unavoidably – a matter of taste.

Conventions used in this blog post
Command line interaction
Whenever I introduce a new concept, I also try to illustrate it via an interaction in a JavaScript command line. This looks as follows:
    > 3 + 4
    7
The text after the greater-than character is the input, typed by a human. Everything else is output by the JavaScript engine. Additionally, the method console.log() is sometimes used to print data to the console (this method works in most JavaScript environments, including Node.js).
Finding documentation
Sometimes, you see functions and methods in action, which should make it clear how they work. If not, there are links to pages of the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), where you can look up the details. Additionally, you can use Google to find documentation on MDN. For example, the following Google search finds the documentation for the push() method of arrays:
    mdn array push
The nature of the language
This section gives a little background on the nature of JavaScript, to help you understand why it is the way it is.The text after the greater-than character is the input, typed by a human. Everything else is output by the JavaScript engine. Additionally, the method console.log() is sometimes used to print data to the console (this method works in most JavaScript environments, including Node.js).
